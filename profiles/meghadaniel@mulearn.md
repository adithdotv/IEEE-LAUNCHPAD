## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m a dedicated and curious final year Computer Science and Engineering student at the College of Engineering, Chengannur. My enthusiasm for building technology goes hand-in-hand with my love for helping others learn it too.

Whether guiding peers through programming concepts or leading collaborative sessions, I’ve discovered a passion for teaching code. Alongside this, I enjoy creating responsive applications and writing clean, efficient code.

My experience includes building  web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and developing backend services using Python and Flask. Notably, I developed a **health risk prediction system** powered by machine learning—gaining hands-on experience with data analysis and predictive modeling.
