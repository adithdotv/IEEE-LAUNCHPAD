### About Me

I am a passionate and driven Blockchain Developer & Full Stack Engineer with 2+ years of hands-on experience building decentralized applications, smart contracts, and scalable full-stack web platforms. With strong technical foundations in Solidity, React.js, Node.js, and database systems, I’ve delivered impactful solutions across Ethereum, Chiliz Chain, and Somnia testnet environments.

My journey includes building NFT-based SportFi apps, fantasy gaming platforms, social marketplaces, and enterprise-level management tools. I emphasize gas optimization, security best practices, and real-time interactivity in DApps.

I’m always exploring new blockchain networks, coding tools, and tech communities to stay at the edge of innovation. Currently seeking opportunities where I can build secure, performant, and meaningful Web3 applications.
